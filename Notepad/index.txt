Here, I will prove that sending and distributing leads does not replace existing tags.

I used:
- Client name in emm: client1761796717
- Campaign ID in emm: 37342075
- Email contact in ghl: johndoe1-20251126035354-37342075@example.com
- Phone contact in ghl: 1126035354

Step 1: 
- I will try to send test contact ✅
- in the middle of the road i added a tag to the contact via ghl ✅
- I will try to send test contact again ✅

Step 2: 
- in the middle of the road i added a tag to the contact via ghl ✅
- I will test as if the contact is distributed ✅
